# Forecast-Data-Processing
Preprocessing of wind power prediction data, first_Preprocessing: the cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between the missing value rows and other rows to identify and fill in the missing values in the dataset. Meanwhile, we processed two types of anomalous data: (1) the wind speed of the wind measurement tower at the high position was lower than that at the low position; (2) the difference between the wind directions at each height of the wind measurement tower was more than 30 degrees; (3) the turbine states were all 0 at a specific time point; and (4) the other state parameters of the turbine were greater than 0 while the power generated was 0. For these anomalous data, we adopted the data from the previous time point to replace the anomalous values with the strategy. second_Preprocessing: Processes the outlier 0.001 that appears in the data set.
